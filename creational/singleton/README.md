# Singleton Pattern

The Singleton is a creational pattern that ensures a class has at most one instance and provides a global point of access to this instance.

#### Benefits

- Anti Pattern
- Lazy Loaded
- YAGNI - You ain't gonna need it
- Reduced memory usage
- We are guaranteed one instance

#### Use cases

1. Configuration Manager
2. Connection Pool
3. Logging Service
4. Hardware Interface Access

#### Limitations and Pitfalls

1. Violation of the Single Responsibility Principle
2. Difficulty in Unit Testing
3. Global Scope
